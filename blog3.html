            <p>long car ride up, couldnt wait 2 stretch my legs. dinner was supa chill that night, didnt wanna overdo it tho cuz it was after a long drive n busy days were ahead. prolly ran like 5 outta 6 mornings (or 4 outta 5), preppin 4 cross country season. last summer i slacked on dat n it hurt me. hit up amusement parks all day - roller coasters were my jam, water parks n chillin at pools were dope too. defo worth every sec.</p>
