            <h2>Trip to Boston</h2>
            <p>Posted on March 10, 2005</p>
            <p>the 4x800 relay team & i were able to make it up to boston this weekend for our nat. champ meet.. defo not easy to qualify  for this, but we ran a time of 8:07.86, we were SUPER shocked!!!! wsnt sure if i could make the trip bc i had the stupid SAT that weekend (¬､¬) and parents were working hella 2, but we were able to figure it out w my dad & we made our way up the day b4.</p>
            <p>ride was looonnggggg omg so boring, but its wtvr cuz we relaxed for that night,i did a lil shakeout run & then went 2 get sum to eat for dinner & stayed at the hotel for the rest of the night. we wanted 2 do smth together, but we couldnt plan it out :(. after waking up the next morning we headed over to the track, TONS of time before our race. i saw sum insane performances!!! SO MANY RECORDS BROKEN & all the things you would expect at a meet like this!!!! our event came ‘round, & we ran 8:11, kinda avg if im being honest. but still boston was super cool and id love to go back!!!</p>
